**Iris Group 2:** Davis, Mel, Chiapo – Fall 2025 

This is a project where the Iris data set was analyzed.  

The dataset contains measurements of 150 iris flowers and includes three different species. 

**Iris-Setosa** 

**Iris-Virginica**

**Iris-Versicolor**

Each flower in the data set has a petal length and width as well as sepal length and width. 

Throughout the project, there were five phases to complete.  

**Phase 1:** We set up our repository and determined our method of pushing and pulling our modifications, which was Google Colab. 

**Phase 2:** We got a feel for how our newly learned Python skills apply to the Iris dataset. We practiced creating variables, implementing control structures and loops, and creating a function to help us classify flowers. 

**Phase 3:** We imported the iris data set along with the pandas library to create DataFrames, generate summary statistics, and remove the duplicates from the original iris dataset. We then saved this as our new ‘iris_cleaned.csv’. 

**Phase 4:** Using our newly cleaned dataset, we imported matplotlib to aid with data visualization. Then, we grouped each flower species within the four categories (sepal length & width, petal length & width). Finally, we were tasked with creating histograms, box plots, bar charts, and scatter plots and using insights from those visuals to answer questions about the dataset.
